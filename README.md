# Automatic Plant Watering System

## Overview

The Automatic Plant Watering System is a project built with the ESP32 IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF). It enables automated watering of plants using a water pump. Additionally, it supports scheduled watering times and manual control via a web application. This project is designed to provide a versatile and efficient solution for maintaining optimal hydration levels for plants.

## Features

- **Automated Watering:** Activates a water pump to irrigate the plants at preconfigured times or manually through a web application.
- **Scheduled Watering:** Allows preconfigured watering times to ensure regular hydration for the plants.
- **Manual Control via Web Application:** Enables manual control of the watering system through a user-friendly web application.
- **ESP-IDF Framework:** Developed using the ESP32 IoT Development Framework for reliable and efficient operation.
- **Configurable Parameters:** Easily configure watering duration and other parameters through the web application.

## Components

- **ESP32 Microcontroller:** Controls the entire system and manages communication with the water pump and the web application.
- **Water Pump:** Activates to deliver water to the plants when triggered by scheduled times or manual control.
- **ESP-IDF:** The ESP32 IoT Development Framework used for programming the ESP32.
- **Web Application:** A user interface for manual control accessible through a web browser.
